Day #17 Today i've learned:
1) Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords
2) How to declare a variable with const keyword (Note: A common practice when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with words separated by an underscore.)
3) How to mutate an Array Declared with const
4) How to Prevent Object Mutation (Note Object.freeze
5) How to Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions (Note: const myFunc = () => "value")
6) How to Write Arrow Functions with Parameters (Note: const doubler = (item) => item * 2;)
7) How to Write Higher Order Arrow Functions (Note: to make the code more succinct)
8) How to Set Default Parameters for Your Functions
